The group holds its general meetings at 7:30pm on the second Tuesday of every month from September to June. (There are no meetings in July and August.) Meetings are open to the general public; you don't have to be a member to attend. Presentation topics vary, but are always announced in advance in the monthly newsletter.

Please note our new meeting location: 1M28 Manitoba Hall, University of Winnipeg, entrance on Ellice Ave. between Spence and Balmoral St. (Check out the UofW's maps for nearby parking locations.)

If you have any suggestions for meeting topics, or (better yet) if you or someone you know would like to present, please contact the board at [board@muug.mb.ca](mailto:board@muug.mb.ca).
