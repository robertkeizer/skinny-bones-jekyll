The Manitoba UNIX User Group (MUUG) is a local group of computer users, based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, who share an interest in UNIX(R), Linux, and open source technology. MUUG's main objective is to allow members to meet others with similar interests, and provide a forum for sharing ideas and information about open systems and their applications.

MUUG is comprised of members from the education, government and business communities, with varying levels of UNIX experience. From its humble beginnings in 1986, the group has grown from about 15 members to over 50 today.

The group meets at 7:30 PM on the second Tuesday of every month from September to June. Meeting locations and presentation topics vary, but are always announced in advance in the monthly newsletter. Membership fees are $20 per year.

MUUG also has a few [mailing lists](/mailing-lists/), which are used to announce upcoming events, and allow members (and anyone interested in UNIX and Linux) to exchange information.

MUUG's operation is governed by a set of [by-laws](/by-laws/) ratified by the members.
